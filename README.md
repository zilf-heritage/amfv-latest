# A Mind Forever Voyaging (Latest)

## What is this?

This repository contains source code and other files which were, as far as anyone can tell, involved in the final work on the Infocom game A Mind Forever Voyaging.

## Where did it come from?

This repository was forked from [zil-legacy/amfv-rlater-eblong](https://github.com/zil-legacy/amfv-rlater-eblong).

## What is it for?

Apart from the obvious historical and educational interest, I think it would be really good to know if a game file can be built from the source code in this repository using Jesse McGrew's ZILF toolset.
